# sandboxer

Basic sandboxing environment for all kinds of experiments. The idea is to mainly use existing images to keep it as simple as possible for new Docker users.


Currently insecure for production and only intended for educational purposes and quick testing + learning Docker, and I wanted it to be very simple to spin up without having to think about file permissions on the host. Etc. Etc.

Run the containers:
```
docker compose up
```

Stop the containers:
```
docker compose stop
```
Or hit `CTRL` + `C` inside your console window.

View your running containers after starting them:
```
docker ps
```

If you need CLI access to the database:

```
docker exec -it sandboxer-db bash
mariadb -uroot -p
```

The `root` password is `superduperroot`.

- To open phpMyAdmin, open `http://database.localhost` in a browser.
- To open the default (localhost) website host, open `http://localhost`
