# sandboxer

Basic sandboxing environment for all kinds of experiments. The idea is to mainly use existing images to keep as simple as possible for new Docker users.


Currently insecure for production and only intended for educational purposes and quick testing + learning Docker, and I wanted it to be very simple to spin up without having to think about file permissions on the host.
